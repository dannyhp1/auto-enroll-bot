# Automatic Enrollment
A tool that enables students to specify which courses they'd like to enroll in. If the course is full, the tool will incrementally check if the course is open. If the course is open, the tool will automatically enroll the student in the course as well as send them a notification to their mobile device.

# Usage

Through Twilio's trial account, a notification will be sent to your mobile device when a course and its corresponding discussion section opens. 

Automatic enrollment will attempt to enroll you in the course based on provided information. Through Twilio, you will receive another message on whether its successful or not.

# Updates
Automatic Enrollment is currently a work in progress. All courses are hardcoded at the moment for personal use.
